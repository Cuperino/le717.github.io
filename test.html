  <h1 class="text-center">About</h1>
  <p>I am a <span id="my-age"></span> year old programmer, Web developer, and all-around technology fan harkening from Georgia, USA, of course!</p>

  <p>In late 2012 I was introduced to the magical world of programming, and by January 2013 I began teaching myself <a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/">Python programming</a>. That September I enrolled at <a target="_blank" href="http://southeasterntech.edu/">Southeastern Technical College</a> and obtained my Associate's degree in Website development, where I gradute in December 2015. Because of my programming knowledge and abilities, I have often been called a Python and JavaScript reference guide!</p>

  <p>To me, programming is not about trying to write something that will be picked up by some big corporation and bought for lots of money. Instead, it is about doing my job in the most excellent way possible and making the product work so well that users never have to think about how or why it works, it just works.</p>

  <p>I am a strong supporter of open-source software (OSS). I believe some of the best software currently available is OSS software. That is why I both contribute to OSS and release most of my own work on <a target="_blank" href="{{ site.github.owner_url }}">GitHub</a>.</p>
