  Yes, you can contact me. However, I have not aquired a way to set up a contact form,<br>
  you get to settle on contacting me on <a target="_blank" href="{{ site.wp_url }}/contact">WordPress.com</a> or <a target="_blank" href="{{ site.github.owner_url }}/feedback#readme">GitHub</a>.

<p>Oh, and enjoy a CSS3 animation while you are here. :stuck_out_tongue:</p>
