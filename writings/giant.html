  <p>Now, in the days of Shomen, there were many sayings of the land of Giant. These things were strange, and they baffled the wisest of all men throughout all the land in that day, because the sayings of the land of Giant were strange. It was never quite understood what these sayings meant, nor how someone could profit from these sayings, as the sayings were so strange.</p>

  <p>One day, a lad from the land of Goggles said to the elders &#8220;I am going to land of Giant, and will spy out the land. I will see all that the land offers, and bring back a report to all people, telling about the land of Giant, and what these sayings, which baffle the wisest of all men throughout all the land, mean. (Are not the sayings indeed strange, and they baffle the wisest of all men throughout all the land?)</p>

  <p>But the elders scoffed at the boy, saying &#8220;The land of Giant is far away, about ten thousand miles, which is a two years journey by foot. How will we know you have made it to the land of Giant, and were not eaten by a wild beast on the way there? Further more, how will we know, if you do indeed enter the land of Giant, that you will not be killed there, for the land is strange, and the sayings of it, which baffle the wisest of all men throughout all the land, are stranger still? If you were to die in the land of Giant, what would your parents do? For you are their only son, and if you die, and if bring the hair of your father down to the grave with him from hearing that you are dead, how will your mother survive, being a widow and outliving both her son and husband?</p>

  <p>But these sayings did not discourage the lad. So the lad did as he said, and went and spied out the land of Giant, to learn what these sayings mean, and what the land of Giant was like. After two years of journeying by foot to the land of Giant, the lad crossed over into the land of Giant, and straight away proceeded to spy out the land of Giant, and to learn about the land and to learn what the strange sayings of the land of Giant, which baffled the wisest of all men throughout all the land in that day, learn what these sayings meant.</p>

  <p>One day, while passing through a thicket of trees, the lad came across a sight. A sight, which he himself at first thought was in illusion, until he remembered he was in the land of Giant. This sight was the very picture of the land of Giant, and the lad though to himself &#8220;Surely this is where the strange sayings of the land of Giant draw their origins, for this is a sight!&#8221;</p>

  <p>The lad drew nearer to this thing, for he wanted to see more of this sight of the land of Giant, which was as strange was the sayings, which baffled the wisest of all men throughout all the land in that day, for the sayings and the land both were indeed strange. So the lad drew nearer. As the lad draw nearer, he saw an object which he had not seen farther back, and he remarked &#8220;Now surely this is where the strange sayings of the land of Giant draw their origins, for this is truly is a sight!&#8221;</p>

  <p>Now the boy drew nearer and nearer to the sight, until he stood almost at the sight which he beheld. And the lad said to himself &#8220;This rightfully is where the strange sayings of the land of Giant, which baffle the wisest of all men throughout all the land, this is the origins of it all!</p>

  <p>Afterward, the lad drew a tablet from his sack, and begin to sketch this sight, which was indeed origins of all the strange sayings of the land of Giant, which baffle the wisest of all men throughout all the land of the day.</p>

  <p>After the lad finished his sketch, he lay down on the shade of the thicket of trees, and said to himself &#8220;Now that the land of Giant has been understood, and that it&#8217;s strangeness is no more, I will lie here and rest, and in three days, start back on my return, to show and tell all the wise men of the land what the strange sayings of the land of Giant mean, and all about the land of Giant.</p>

  <p>This is the sketch which the lad from the land of Goggles sketched of the sight which he had seen in the land of Giant, and from which all the strange sayings of the land of Giant, which baffle the wisest of all men throughout all the land of the day, drew it&#8217;s origin. The sight is indeed a sight to behold, and it will also explain to you the strangeness of the land of Giant.</p>
