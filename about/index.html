<h3>Who is this guy?</h3>
<p>I am Caleb Ely, a <span id="my-age"></span> year old programmer, Web developer, and all-around technology fan harkening from Georgia, USA.</p>

<p>In late 2012 I was introduced to the magical world of programming, and by January 2013 I began teaching myself <a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/">Python programming</a>. That September I enrolled at<a target="_blank" href="http://southeasterntech.edu/">Southeastern Technical College</a> and obtained my Associate's degree in Website development. Because of my programming knowledge and abilities, I have been called a Python and JavaScript reference guide!</p>

<p>To me, programming is not about trying to write something that will be picked up by some big corporation and bought for lots of money. Instead, it is about writing a program to make a job perform well so others will never have to think about how or why it works, it just works.</p>

<p>I am a strong supporter of open-source software (OSS). I believe some of the best software currently available is OSS software. Tat is why I both contribute to OSS and release most of my own work on <a target="_blank" href="{{ site.github.owner_url }}">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h3>Wanna talk?</h3>
