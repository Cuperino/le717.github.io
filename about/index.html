  <h2 class="text-center">About</h2>
  <p>Hello! I am Triangle717 (pronounced Triangle seven one seven), sometimes known as le717 (pronounced lee seven seventeen).
    I am <span id="i-am-age"></span> years old, harkening from Triangle Land, Georgia, USA.
  </p>

  <p>I am a Christian, born and raised in a Christian home, and I am not afraid to publicly proclaim my faith in God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit.</p>

  <blockquote>
    For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes...

  <p>I have been a programmer for <span id="i-am-programmer">one and a half</span> years. After discovering the world of programming in October 2013 by completing the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy HTML Fundamentals</a> track
    and reading <a target="_blank" href="http://swaroopch.com/notes/python/"><span class="text-italic">A Byte of Python</span></a>
    by <a target="_blank" href="http://swaroopch.com/">Swaroop C H</a>,
    I discovered what I been developing the mental capacity to accomplish since I was a little boy.
    I am CompTIA Security+ certified, and am presently knowledgeable in <span id="code-i-know"></span>, but I plan on learning more.</p>

  <p>I am currently attending technical college to obtain my associates degree in website design and development, with graduation in Summer 2015.</p>

  <p>Open-source software (OSS) is some of the best software out there, and I am proud to be a strong supporter of OSS.
    All of my programming work is available on <a target="_blank" href="{{ site.github.owner_url }}">GitHub</a> and licensed using an OSS license.

  <h2 class="text-center">About Triangle Land</h2>
  <p><span class="text-bold">Triangle Land</span> is a <a target="_blank" href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll-powered</a>, <a target="_blank" href="{{ site.github.repository_url }}">open-source</a> HTML5 website hosted on <a target="_blank" href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>. I have written everything by hand, with much of the design by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/_rioforce">rioforce</a>a. The intent of this site is to serve as a live playground for items I cannot host on <a target="_blank" href="{{ site.author_wp }}">WordPress.com</a> and to help me better learn client-side web development.</p>

  <p>As of 31 March, 2014, Triangle Land is under heavy construction, and things will change, break, and move around without notice. I am sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.</p>
