<h3>Who is this guy?</h3>
<p>I am Caleb Ely, a programmer, Web developer, and all-around technology fan harkening from Georgia, USA.</p>

<p>To me, programming is not about trying to write something that will be picked up by some big corporation and bought for lots of money. Instead, it is doing my job in such an excellent way and making the product work so well that users never have to think about how or why it works, it just works.</p>

<p>I am a strong supporter of open-source software (OSS). I believe some of the best software currently available is OSS software. Tat is why I both contribute to OSS and release most of my own work on <a target="_blank" href="{{ site.github.owner_url }}">GitHub</a>.</p>
