> My [Jekyll-powered](http://jekyllrb.com/) website written from scratch.

I am utilizing HTML5 and CSS3, so a modern browser is recommended browsing. I would define a "modern browser" as Internet Explorer 11 equivalent or better. If you need a modern browser, visit [Browse Happy](http://browsehappy.com/) to pick one out. I personally recommend Mozilla Firefox. :smiley:
