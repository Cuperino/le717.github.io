[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/le717/le717.github.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/le717/le717.github.io) [![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/le717/le717.github.io/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/le717/le717.github.io#info=devDependencies)

My very Jekyll-based website, which I am writing completely from scratch. Although the majority of my content is located on [WordPress.com](http://Triangle717.WordPress.com), much of that will eventually be ported to here. This also serves as a live playground for various things, such as my CSS3 animation [**Not Pong**](http://le717.github.io/fun/notpong.html).

I am utilizing many HTML5 and CSS3 elements, and as such a fairly modern browser is recommended for best browsing. For reference, Internet Explorer 10 is probably the lowest support I have. If you need a modern browser, visit  [browsehappy.com](http://browsehappy.com/) to pick one out. I personally recommend Mozilla Firefox. (No, I have not been paid to recommended them. :stuck_out_tongue:)

## Third-party Libraries ##

I've used some very nice third-party libraries and styling on my site. I recommend checking them out. :smiley:
