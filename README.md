Possible future home of my website. My website can currently be found on [WordPress.com](http://Triangle717.WordPress.com). In the mean time, I use this as a portal to my other projects that make use of [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com).

Oh yea, almost forgot. I wrote an HTML5 and CSS3 animation entitled **Not Pong** for you to enjoy (best enjoyed on desktop browsers), but it can be
a bit buggy depending your browser. Please consult the table below for browser compatibility (I update it as bugs are fixed/changes are 
made).:smile:

If you need a modern browser, go to [browsehappy.com](http://browsehappy.com/) to pick one out. I personally recommend Mozilla Firefox.
