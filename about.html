  <h1 class="text-center">About</h1>
  <p>Hello! I am <span class="text-bold">Triangle717</span> (pronounced <span class="text-bold">Triangle seven one seven</span>), sometimes known as
    <span class="text-bold">le717</span> (pronounced <span class="text-bold">lee seven seventeen</span>).
    I am <span class="generated-data" id="i-am-age" title="My age is calculated automatically. :D"></span> years old, harkening from Triangle Land, Georgia, USA.</p>
  <p>I am also a Christian, born and raised in a Christian home, and I am not afraid to publicly proclaim my faith in God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit.</p>

  <blockquote>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes...

  <p>I am a programmer of nearly one and a half years. After discovering the world of programming in October 2013 by completing the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy HTML Fundamentals</a> track and <a target="_blank" href="http://swaroopch.com/notes/python/"><span class="text-italic">A Byte of Python</span></a> book by <a target="_blank" href="http://swaroopch.com/">Swaroop C H</a>,
I discovered what I been developing the mental capacity to accomplish since I was 4 years old. Presently, I am knowledgeable in
<span id="code-i-know" title="This list is also automatically generated. :D"></span>, but I plan on learning more.</p>

  <p>I am attending technical college to obtain my associates degree in website design and development. Currently projected graduation date is 2015.</p>

  <p>I am a strong supporter of open-source programming. That is why you will find all my programming work on <a target="_blank" href="{{ site.github.owner_url }}">GitHub</a>.
    Links to various projects and downloads for them can be found on the <a target="_blank" href="{{ site.wpurl }}/code/">Source Code</a> and <a target="_blank" href="{{ site.wpurl }}/downloads/">Downloads</a> pages on my WordPress.com
    <a target="_blank" href="{{ site.wpurl }}">blog</a>, respectively, in addition to many of the project's appropriate Releases page.
