  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hello! I am <span class="bold">Triangle717</span> (pronounced <span class="bold">lee seven one seven</span>), sometimes known as
    <span class="bold">le717</span> (pronounced <span class="bold">lee seven seventeen</span>). I am
    <span title="My age is calculated automatically. :D" id="i-am-age"></span> years old, harkening from Triangle Land, Georgia, USA.<br>
    I am a Christian, born and raised in a Christian home, and I am not afraid to publicly proclaim my faith in God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit.
    <br><br>
    I am a programmer of nearly one and a half years. After discovering the world of programming in October 2013 by going through the  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.codecademy.com">Codcademy HTML Fundamentals</a> track and following <a target="_blank" href="http://swaroopch.com/notes/python/"><em>A Byte of Python</em></a> by<br><a target="_blank" href="http://swaroopch.com/">Swaroop C H</a>,
    I discovered what God had prepared me for though the hardships I have endured.
    <br><br>
    I am currently attending technical college to obtain my associates degree in website design and development. Projected graduation date is Spring or Summer 2015.
    <br><br>
    I am a strong supporter of open-source programs. You will find all my programming work on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/le717">GitHub</a>.
    Links to various projects and downloads for them can be found on the <a target="_blank" href="http://Triangle717.WordPress.com/code/">Source  Code</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://Triangle717.WordPress.com/downloads/">Downloads</a> pages of my
  <a target="_blank" href="http://Triangle717.WordPress.com/">blog</a>, respectively.
