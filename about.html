  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hello! I am <span class="bold">Triangle717</span> (pronounced <span class="bold">Triangle seven one seven</span>), sometimes known as
    <span class="bold">le717</span> (pronounced <span class="bold">lee seven seventeen</span>). 
    I am <span title="My age is calculated automatically. :D" id="i-am-age"></span> years old, harkening from Triangle Land, Georgia, USA.<br>
    I am also a Christian, born and raised in a Christian home, and I am not afraid to publicly proclaim my faith in God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit.

    <blockquote>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes...

  I am a programmer of nearly one and a half years. After discovering the world of programming in October 2013 by completing the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy HTML Fundamentals</a> track and <a target="_blank" href="http://swaroopch.com/notes/python/"><span class="italic">A Byte of Python</span></a> book by
    <a target="_blank" href="http://swaroopch.com/">Swaroop C H</a>, I discovered what God had prepared me for though the hardships I have endured.
    <br><br>
    I am currently attending technical college to obtain my associates degree in website design and development. Projected graduation date is Spring or Summer 2015.
    <br><br>
    I am a strong supporter of open-source programming. That is why you will find all my programming work on <a target="_blank" href="{{ site.github.owner_url }}">GitHub</a>.
    Links to various projects and downloads for them can be found on the <a target="_blank" href="http://Triangle717.WordPress.com/code/">Source  Code</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://Triangle717.WordPress.com/downloads/">Downloads</a> pages on my WordPress.com
    <a target="_blank" href="http://Triangle717.WordPress.com/">blog</a>, respectively, in addition to many of the project's appropriate Releases page.
