<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! I am <strong>Triangle717</strong> (pronounced <strong>lee seven one seven</strong>), sometimes known as <strong>le717</strong> (pronounced 
  <strong>lee seven seventeen</strong>).<br>I am 19 years old, harkening from Triangle Land, Georgia, USA. I am a Christian, born and raised in a 
  Christian home, and I am not afraid to publicly proclaim my faith in God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit.
  <br><br>
  I am a programmer. After discovering the world of programming in October 2013 by going through the  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.codecademy.com">Codcademy HTML Fundamentals</a> track and following <a target="_blank" href="http://swaroopch.com/notes/python/"><em>A Byte of Python</em></a> by<br><a target="_blank" href="http://swaroopch.com/">Swaroop C H</a>,
  I discovered what God had prepared me for though the hardships I have endured.
  <br><br>
  I am currently attending technical college to obtain my associates degree in website design and development. Projected graduation date is Spring or Summer 2015.
  <br><br>
  I am a strong supporter of open-source programs. You will find all my programming work on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/le717">GitHub</a>.
  Links to various projects and downloads for them can be found on the <a target="_blank" href="http://Triangle717.WordPress.com/code/">Source  Code</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://Triangle717.WordPress.com/downloads/">Downloads</a> pages of my
<a target="_blank" href="http://Triangle717.WordPress.com/">blog</a>, respectively.
